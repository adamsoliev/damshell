## Damshell

There are a number of tutorial text editor implementations online. This repository will host my learnings from them and my own implementation in C, fusing interesting ideas taken from them. Later, I might add ones written in C++ and Python.

My main goal from this project is

- practise document/test driven development
- improve my C

### Design

### Supported features

### Sources

- [kilo](https://viewsourcecode.org/snaptoken/kilo/index.html) - this is a very nice instruction booklet that shows you how to build a text editor in C.
